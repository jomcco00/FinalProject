Integrity Statement

"I, Joshua McCormack, did not consult with anyone about the material for this exam except for Kyle. I did not use any resources aside from those listed on the final exam assignment.
I understand that any breach of this agreement will result in a score of 0 on this exam and also involve administrative penalties."

Refactoring
The factoring I primarily used was extract function.
This was primarily used to take all of the code that was sitting
in the main method (Kyle if there is anything I learned during my
Computer Science degree, is that this hurts to look at, and kills
my soul a little,) and extract it into separate methods or functions.
These could then be called be each other, or by the main method.
This allows for far more usability, and means that this can be much
more easily, lets say, made "Better" perhaps? This is by far my favorite
change, as well as the largest change between my version of RiverDiscoverer,
and its original form.
