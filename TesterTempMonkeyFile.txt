You have found the mouth of a new river where it spills into the sea.  What do the locals call this river?
How much water is flowing into the sea?  (L/s)
How far did you walk until you reached the next junction? (in km)
Are you done traveling upstream on the Nile? (y/N)
That means you must be at another confluence.  What is the name the locals have given the river flowing into this one?
How much water is flowing from that tributary into the main river?  (L/s)

Great!  We're done!
You have now explored the Nile!
The river is at least 4850 km long.
From the furthest distance we explored:
1466000 L/s flows 750 km downstream.
Then, the Dinder River flows into the river.
Then 1578000 L/s flows 700 km downstream.
Then, the White Nile flows into the river.
Then 2456000 L/s flows 400 km downstream.
Then, the Atbarah River flows into the river.
2830000 L/s flows 3000 km downstream.
Then the Nile flows into the sea.
